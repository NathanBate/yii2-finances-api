# Personal Project: Finances API

This was a personal project that I did a few years ago that I use weekly for
my own personal finances. 

There are two caveats with this repo:
1. As with an personal project, it never gets enough love as it should.
2. When I originally wrote this, I was still learning the Yii2 web framework. I have done some production level code in Yii2, but it is not something I can put in a public repo.

This is a fullstack app. This repo is the backend. The Finances frontend
app can be found [here](https://github.com/NathanBate/yii2-finances-app).
