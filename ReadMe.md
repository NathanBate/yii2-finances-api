# Personal Project: Finances API

This was a personal project that I did a few years ago that I use weekly for
my own personal finances. 

There are two caveats with this repo:
1. As with an personal project, it never gets enough love as it should.
2. When I originally wrote this, I was still learning the Yii2 web framework.

This is a fullstack app. This repo is the backend. The Finances frontend
app can be found [here](http://github.com/nathanbate/).

## Installation

`composer install`

`./console install`

`./console migrate`
